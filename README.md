# Google Machine Learning Course - Notes & Projects  

## About This Repository  

Hey, my name is Stav, and I'm a Fullstack Developer with years of experience.  

If you're looking for my Fullstack projects, you wonâ€™t find them hereâ€”check out my profile for that.  
This repository, however, is dedicated to my journey through Google's Machine Learning course.  

I decided to take this course because I have a deep passion for technology and a natural curiosity for learning and exploring interesting fields. Machine learning is a fascinating world with immense potential, and I felt compelled to understand how this "magic" actually works.  

To achieve this, I created this repository to:  
- Document my progress, notes, and key takeaways from the course.  
- Share summaries of each module and its core topics.  
- Store hands-on projects and exercises I implement to solidify my understanding.  

I hope this repository will be useful not only for me but also for others interested in learning machine learning. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!  

Happy coding! ðŸš€
